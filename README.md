# Programming101

The Github repo for the first course from [HackBulgaria](http://hackbulgaria.com) - Programming 101.

Different materials will be commited here. Mosty programming tasks and Python unit test cases.

Content will be separated in different folders, for the given week, starting with week0.

## How to use this repository

The first separation if based on weeks - starting from week 0.

__In each week, there are markdown files__ with task descriptions in them.

Each week has a `materials.md` file, where we put the things that need to be checked first, before going into task-solving.

Usually, you will find code samples, links and videos about the topic of the week.

* __week5__ - Introducing team-work problems and how to use Git & GitHub for handling a team of more than 1 person. We create a simulation of a Zoo - Teamwork + OOP + sqlite3 + TDD
* __week6__ - Introducing basic security concepts - hashing, SQL Injection, hiding passwords from input, bruteforce protections. There is an app waiting to be refactored.
