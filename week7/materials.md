# ORM with SQLAlchemy

For the final week of the course, we are going to deal with ORM and the [Python library SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)!

The best way to get started with SQLAlchemy is to watch the video and follow the materials from here: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/library.html#introductiontosqlalchemy

There are slides and code examples too!
